yontma
======

yontma (You'll Never Take Me Alive!) is a tool designed to protect data on laptops from being stolen.

How It Works
------------

yontma runs as a service on BitLocker-protected Windows laptops. If the laptop is disconneted from AC power or wired Ethernet while the screen is locked, yontma puts the machine into hibernate. This prevents a laptop thief from accessing your encrypted data later via a DMA attack while the machine is still powered on and the decryption keys are in memory.
